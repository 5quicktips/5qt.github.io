Being in the web industry since 2007, I have somewhat mastered the trade of putting content and websites online. I designed websites for myself and clients using different platforms, CMS systems and programming languages. When I finished a website, a customer was happy, we placed the good piece on the internet and my work was done there and the customers would take it on from there. I was not hired to do the SEO.

As my skills advanced and I was learning more about web development mainly through YouTube and Google, I started liking the fact that I can share my knowledge with other people and make some money passively while doing so. A few years ago I started more and more thinking about creating content and one day made the decision. "I will be a YouTuber!" I created a channel, made a website and started creating my first pieces of content. In my opinion all was right. The design of my website was very good, the length of my videos also, I made good thumbnails...

What I didn't realize is that I made mistakes on almost all the other fields which didn't give me any search results. I made three websites and 3 YouTube channels and improved every time a little. Today I am sharing with you 5 mistakes I made as a content creator that you should avoid.

## Visuals vs Content
Being a web designer and developer the first thing that came in my mind after not receiving any results was that my website didn't look good enough or maybe it was written in the wrong programming language. So I recreated my website using WordPress, Jekyll, Huge and what not. I even spent days in programming my own themes from scratch. Now don't get me wrong, its not all bad that I did that as I learned a ton by doing so and improved my knowledge in at least 3 languages. It just didn't served the purpose that it should, bringing traffic to my website.

I followed the guides by famous youtubers to write content

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  My name is Admir and I am a freelance web developer from Bosnia and Herzegovina who loves learning, teaching people his skills and creating content online. I started web devepment in 2007 programming websites in HTML & CSS. As the years passed, my skills evolved and so did the platforms and programming languages changed.
</p>
<p>
  I developed interest for YouTube and content creation a few years ago and even had 3 channels and websites and made some videos, but they were not successfull. I was expecting to much and as a web developer focused to much on the look and feel of my site not creating quality content. With 5Quick Tips I will do things differently.
</p>
<p>
  I will create short informational and tutorial videos and posts not longer then 5 minutes. My target audience will be new content creators, bloggers and web developers who want to grow their presence online and learn some new tips and tricks. On this website my audience will find quick articles revolving around the web industry, tools and longer case studies.
</p>
<p>
  In my product or services reviews you will find honest opinions and I will recommend only the things that I personally use.
